Implementation of a server in C++
The focus of this project is to implement an HTTP/1.1 compliant according to the RFC[1]
The server is capable of handling multiple connections through kernel event notification mechanism 

Supported methods:
- GET
- POST
- DELETE

Supported CGI scripts:
- python
- perl
- php

To compile server run: 
$ cd 42_webserv && make

If you use Linux, this will not work because we are using kqueue();

To run server:
Run the executable and press enter or: 
$ ./webserv [optional config.conf]

If no config file is specified, a default one is provided in the config directory.
